MP1 BC's URM Tracer Intro: Binibining Comsci is studying abstract machines
and in particular is interested in learning more about URM's. 
In order to help Binibining Comsci in her quest for dominance in the Comsci world,
we need to create a URM tracer. A URM is an abstract model of a computer as discussed in class. 
Our program reads a input file (ie, mp1.in) and performs the URM instructions as specified. 
For each line of our input, the program will display the current state of the URM on our 
output file (ie, mp1.out). The first line of input in the input file contains the initial 
state of our URM up to 10 indices (not so unlimited, eh?). The succeeding lines are the 
instructions that Binibining Comsci wants to test our URM with.
